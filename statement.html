  <h1><b>Artist Statement<b></h1>
  <p>
Being an artist to me is having the ability to be creative and think "outside the box", while also having fun and enjoying the work created.
I hope that my art presented in the portfolio represent that.
In the digital art shown int he portfolio it consists of multiple different mediums: glitch art, composite art, sound art, video art, and net art. </p>
  <p> A majority of the work shown is a learning process and I think represent my growth within the digital art community.
In the work that I have presented it is certain things that are "outside of the box" and displays how the social issues currently in the world.
